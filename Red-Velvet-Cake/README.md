step one: add Vogon poetry to the provided cake mix available at the following link https://www.youtube.com â€º watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs (the method is up  to you and we are not responsible for any brain damage caused from accidentaly reading the poetry).
step two: mix with arsenic sulphide mineral known as ruby sulphur in a crushed form and mix with the icing packet also included in the link (we are not liable for any/all poisoning that this recipe causes upon you).
step three: put a circular cake mold with the cake mix inside it in the oven and wait for 30 mins with the temperature at 900 degreees celcius.
step four: lathe the cake in the icing and consume (it is recommended that you eat it with a strong acid such as magic acid or hydrochloric acid for that extra tinge)!
